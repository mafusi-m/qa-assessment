RISK ASSESSMENT FOR LORD OF THE RINGS API				
				
RISKS		
				
1.Broken Object Level Authorization	
2.Broken User Authentication	
3.Excessive Data Exposure
4.Lack of Resource & Rate Limiting
5.Mass Assignment 

LEVEL
1.Low	
2.High
3.Medium
4.Low
5.HighI

PROBABILITY
1.Low
2.High
3.High
4.High
5.High

IMPACT
1.If authorization is broken there will be a wide attack area
2.Attacks can exploit authentication tokens to gain access
3.More data one unnecessarily expose, will lead to unnecessary risk	
4.If API has no limitations on number of resources that can be called, it is open to wide detrimental attack
5.Hackers can easily intercept requests and reverse-engineer a private API

MITIGATION
1.Use an API gateway and implement object-level authorization checks. Require access tokens to permit access
2.Secure user authentication, and only ensure trusted users are authenticated
3.Limit data exposure to only trusted parties who need it. By using OAuth Scopes and claim
4.Put rate limits on APIs using API gateway or management solution, put restrictions on responses also
5.Act like a hacker to find vulnerabilities
